# Issues fixed

Input Validation:

Added a check to ensure the developers field exists and is an array.

Responded with a 400 Bad Request status if the input is invalid.

Error Handling for Individual Requests:

Wrapped the GitHub API request in a try-catch block to handle errors for each individual developer.

Logged errors for each failed request and returned default values ('N/A' for name and bio) instead of failing the entire process.

Default Values:

Added default values ('N/A') for name and bio fields if the GitHub API response doesn't include these fields.
Error Logging:

Enhanced error logging to provide more context when an error occurs during the API request for a specific developer.
